//better approach to do iterative approach : coz of stack overflow
// number of recursive calls is equal to log(n)
// number of levels in recursion tree is log(n)+1
// how many subproblems are there at a level j?
// ====> 2^j
//what is the size of each subproblem?
// ====> (n/2)^j

// at each level the complexity of merge operation is O(n/(2^j)*2^j)= O(n)
// total number of levels = log(n)..therefore complexity of merge sort at all levels is equal to nlog(n)
